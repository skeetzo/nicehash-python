**nicehash-python**
fork of nicehash/rest-clients-demo with updated python client

# rest-clients-demo

### Source

- [python](https://github.com/nicehash/rest-clients-demo/blob/master/python/nicehash.py)

### TEST environment

Generate Api key and Secret for test platform on:

https://test.nicehash.com (User / Settings / API Keys)
Organization ID is displayed just above "+ Create new API key" button.

Use https://api-test.nicehash.com for API domain.

The entire platform runs on testnet. This means that you donâ€™t have to use your own funds to test the platform. This is the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the new system, place hash-power orders and try trading without spending any real money.
